### Project Ideas
1) Improving Mask Detection - CV
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01816v1.pdf
- Proposes a method similar to project previously conducted in https://github.com/nlee-208/face_mask_detection
- Utilizes SSD & YOLOV5 for the classifier... what else can be done?

2) Code Implementation of ViT, MLP-Mixer & gMLP on CIFAR-100
